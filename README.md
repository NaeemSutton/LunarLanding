# Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing

## Overview
This project implements **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** to train an AI agent to land a lunar module successfully in the `LunarLander-v2` environment from OpenAI Gym. The agent learns through reinforcement learning by optimizing its landing strategy over multiple episodes.

## Features
- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** with experience replay
- **Neural Network** using PyTorch
- **Environment:** OpenAI Gymâ€™s `LunarLander-v2`
- **Performance Tracking:** Training and reward visualization
